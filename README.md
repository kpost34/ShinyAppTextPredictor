# **Text Predictor Shiny App**
Shiny app driven by n-gram model to predict words.

## Introduction
The aim of this project was to build a model to predict the next word when given text, similar to the algorithms used in text messaging and email. An n-gram model with Stupid back-off was developed by training on U.S. tweets, blogs, and news articles. The model was deployed as a Shiny app and presented as slides.
